## Installation

To use this script, you'll need to have a userscript manager like **Tampermonkey** or **Greasemonkey** installed on your browser.

1. Install a userscript manager:
   - I used Tampermonkey v5.3.3 while making it

2. Click on the [script link](./Coppermine%20Gallery%20Downloader.user.js) and click `Raw` then `install` (or paste the script into a new script in the userscript manager).

3. Once installed, navigate to any Coppermine Gallery page, and the script will automatically add a **Download** button to the page.
